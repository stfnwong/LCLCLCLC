# LCLCLCLC

Everyone loves grinding on CS problems right? 

This repo contains experiments for leetcode problems. For whatever reason LC reports huge memory usage even for very simple things. The repo is just a random collection of answers to various questions, but without any real reference to the questions. Quite a lot of it is just profiling.

## Requirements 
- Tests use gtest
- Valgrind (I used massif for heap profiling)
- I used GCC 9.1.1, but there aren't any special features that would require this version.
